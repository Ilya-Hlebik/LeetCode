| [241. Different Ways to Add Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/different-ways-to-add-parentheses/description/) | Each operator (+, -, *) splits the expression into left and right parts. Recursively compute all results for both sides, then combine every left and right result using that operator. Default case - just add expression parsed to int                |
| [257. Binary Tree Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-paths/)                                             | Keep building a path string as you go down: "1->2->5" etc. When you move to left or riht, pass a new string with the updated path (so each branch keeps its own copy). If the current node doesn't have left/right, add the built string to the result. |
| [258. Add Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-digits/description/)                                               | If the result is less than 10, return it (single-digit reached). Sum all digits of the number. Take the sum and repeat the process recursively.                                                                                                        |
| [260. Single Number III](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/description/)                                               | XOR all elements. After this, find the lowest set bit using xor & (-xor), and divide the numbers into two groups: those with this bit set and those without it. The first group will be arr0, and the second will be arr1.|
